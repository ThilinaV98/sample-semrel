## Overview

This guide provides complete step-by-step instructions for manually testing your GitHub Actions workflows and branching strategy by creating real branches, commits, and pull requests.

### Current Project State

- **Current Branch**: `feature/initial-feature` (just committed workflow improvements)
- **Available Branches**: `main`, `dev`, `feature/initial-feature`
- **Workflows**: 5 workflows ready for testing
- **Status**: Ready to test complete development flow

### Testing Philosophy

1. **Real Environment Testing**: Use actual GitHub (not just Act simulation)
2. **Complete Flow Validation**: Test entire branch lifecycle
3. **Expected vs Actual**: Document what should happen vs what does happen
4. **Failure Recovery**: Test error handling and recovery procedures

---

## Prerequisites

### Required Setup

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/cosmo/Documents/Course/sample-semrel

# 2. Verify git is properly configured
git config --list | grep -E "user\.(name|email)"

# 3. Check GitHub CLI is authenticated (optional but helpful)
gh auth status

# 4. Verify all workflows are valid
npm run validate:workflows

# 5. Check current status
git status
git branch -a
```

### Required Permissions

- Push access to repository
- Permission to create pull requests
- Permission to merge pull requests
- Permission to create releases (for testing)

---

## Testing Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Feature Development Flow

> **Purpose**: Test the complete feature development workflow  
> **Flow**: `feature/*` ‚Üí `dev` ‚Üí `release/*` ‚Üí `main`  
> **Duration**: ~15-20 minutes  

### Step 1.1: Complete Current Feature

Since we're already on `feature/initial-feature` with committed changes:

```bash
# Push the current feature branch
git push origin feature/initial-feature
```

**Expected Result**: 
- Branch is pushed to GitHub
- No workflows trigger yet (only on PR creation)

### Step 1.2: Create Pull Request to Dev

```bash
# Create PR using GitHub CLI (or use GitHub web interface)
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: enhance CI/CD workflows and add comprehensive testing" \
  --body "## üöÄ Feature: Enhanced CI/CD Workflows

### Changes Made
- Added hotfix workflow for emergency fixes
- Improved semantic-release workflow with better branch handling
- Added comprehensive testing infrastructure (Act, scripts, documentation)
- Enhanced coverage enforcement (80% threshold)
- Updated configuration for hotfix support

### Testing Done
- ‚úÖ All workflows pass syntax validation
- ‚úÖ Act configuration tested locally
- ‚úÖ Coverage thresholds enforced
- ‚úÖ Conventional commit format validated

### Quality Checklist
- [x] Tests pass
- [x] Linting passes
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Breaking changes documented

Ready for dev integration testing." \
  --base dev \
  --head feature/initial-feature
```

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ **Feature Validation Workflow** (`feature-validation.yml`) triggers
- PR is created with proper formatting
- Status checks appear on the PR

### Step 1.3: Monitor Feature Validation Workflow

```bash
# Watch the workflow progress
gh run list --workflow=feature-validation.yml --limit=1
gh run view --web  # Opens browser to view logs
```

**Expected Workflow Steps**:
1. **Lint & Code Quality** - ‚úÖ Should pass
2. **Build & Test** - ‚úÖ Should pass  
3. **Commit Message Validation** - ‚úÖ Should pass
4. **Security Scan** - ‚úÖ Should pass
5. **Feature Status Check** - ‚úÖ Should pass

**If Issues Occur**: See [Troubleshooting Guide](#troubleshooting-guide)

### Step 1.4: Merge to Dev Branch

Once all checks pass:

```bash
# Merge the PR (via GitHub CLI or web interface)
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
```

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ PR is merged to `dev`
- ‚úÖ `feature/initial-feature` branch is deleted
- ‚úÖ **Dev Integration Workflow** (`dev-integration.yml`) triggers

### Step 1.5: Monitor Dev Integration Workflow

```bash
# Switch to dev branch to see the merge
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Monitor the dev integration workflow
gh run list --workflow=dev-integration.yml --limit=1
```

**Expected Workflow Steps**:
1. **Integration Tests** - ‚úÖ Full test suite with coverage
2. **Pre-release Validation** - ‚úÖ Commit analysis and dry-run
3. **Quality Check** - ‚úÖ Code quality metrics
4. **Dev Integration Status** - ‚úÖ Summary report

### Step 1.6: Verification

```bash
# Verify the merge
git log --oneline -5
git branch -a

# Check for release-ready commits
git log --grep="feat:" --grep="fix:" --grep="perf:" --oneline
```

**Expected State**:
- ‚úÖ Changes are merged into `dev`
- ‚úÖ Dev integration workflow completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Ready for release preparation

## Scenario 2: Release Preparation Flow

> **Purpose**: Test manual release creation and QA workflow  
> **Flow**: `dev` ‚Üí `release/vX.Y.Z-rc.N` ‚Üí `main`  
> **Duration**: ~10-15 minutes  

### Step 2.1: Trigger Release Preparation

Use GitHub's workflow dispatch feature:

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run release-preparation.yml \
  --field source_branch=dev \
  --field release_type=minor \
  --field pre_release_identifier=rc

# Or via web interface:
# Go to Actions > Release Preparation > Run workflow
```

**Input Parameters**:
- **Source Branch**: `dev`
- **Release Type**: `minor` (since we added features)
- **Pre-release Identifier**: `rc`

### Step 2.2: Monitor Release Preparation

```bash
# Watch the workflow
gh run list --workflow=release-preparation.yml --limit=1
gh run view --web
```

**Expected Workflow Steps**:
1. **Validate Source Branch** - ‚úÖ Dev branch validation
2. **Create Release Branch** - ‚úÖ New `release/v*` branch created
3. **Create QA Testing Issue** - ‚úÖ GitHub issue for QA tracking
4. **Notify Completion** - ‚úÖ Summary and next steps

### Step 2.3: Verify Release Branch Creation

```bash
# Fetch latest branches
git fetch origin

# Check for new release branch
git branch -a | grep release

# Switch to the release branch
git checkout release/v1.1.0-rc.1  # (example version)
```

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Release branch `release/v1.1.0-rc.1` exists
- ‚úÖ Package.json version updated to `1.1.0-rc.1`

  --base dev \
  --head feature/search-functionality
```

### Step 4.3: Test Parallel Workflow Execution

Both PRs should trigger feature validation workflows simultaneously:

```bash
# Monitor both workflows
gh run list --limit=10 | grep feature-validation
```

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Both feature validation workflows run in parallel
- ‚úÖ Each PR gets independent status checks
- ‚úÖ No interference between workflows

### Step 4.4: Merge First Feature

```bash
# Merge profiles first
gh pr merge $(gh pr list --head feature/user-profiles --json number --jq '.[0].number') --merge
```

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Profiles feature merges cleanly

## Scenario 5: Failed Workflow Recovery

> **Purpose**: Test error handling and recovery procedures  
> **Flow**: Intentional failures ‚Üí troubleshooting ‚Üí recovery  
> **Duration**: ~10 minutes  

### Step 5.1: Create Failing Feature

```bash
# Create a branch with intentional issues
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/broken-feature

# Add code that will fail tests
echo "
// This will cause test failures
function brokenFunction() {
  throw new Error('Intentional test failure');
}

// This will cause linting errors
var unused_variable = 'unused';
let another-invalid-name = 'invalid';

module.exports = { brokenFunction };
" > src/broken-feature.js

# Add invalid test
echo "
const { brokenFunction } = require('../src/broken-feature');

describe('Broken Feature', () => {
  it('should fail intentionally', () => {
    // This test will fail
    expect(brokenFunction()).toBe('success');
  });
});
" > test/broken-feature.test.js

# Make commit that violates conventions
git add .
git commit -m "add broken stuff"  # Invalid commit message format

git push origin feature/broken-feature
```

### Step 5.2: Create PR to Trigger Failures

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: broken feature for testing" \
  --body "This PR intentionally contains errors to test workflow error handling." \
  --base dev \
  --head feature/broken-feature
```

### Step 5.3: Monitor Failing Workflow

```bash
gh run list --workflow=feature-validation.yml --limit=1
gh run view --web  # View failure details
```

**Expected Failures**:
- ‚ùå **Lint Check**: ESLint errors due to invalid variable names
- ‚ùå **Test Suite**: Test failure due to assertion error
- ‚ùå **Commit Message**: Invalid conventional commit format
- ‚ùå **Coverage**: Possibly insufficient coverage

### Step 5.4: Fix Issues One by One

```bash
# Fix linting issues
echo "
// Fixed version
function workingFunction() {
  return 'success';
}

const validVariable = 'used in export';
const anotherValidName = 'also valid';

module.exports = { workingFunction, validVariable, anotherValidName };
" > src/broken-feature.js

# Fix test
echo "
const { workingFunction } = require('../src/broken-feature');

describe('Working Feature', () => {
  it('should work correctly', () => {
    expect(workingFunction()).toBe('success');
  });
});
" > test/broken-feature.test.js

git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve linting and test issues

- Fix variable naming conventions
- Update function to return expected value
- Fix test assertions
- Ensure proper error handling"

git push origin feature/broken-feature
```

**Expected Results**:

- ‚úÖ Lint and test issues resolved
- ‚úÖ Commit message follows conventions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some checks may still need attention

### Step 5.5: Complete Recovery

```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow=feature-validation.yml --limit=2

# Once all checks pass, merge
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
```

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ All workflow checks pass
- ‚úÖ PR successfully merged
- ‚úÖ Error recovery process validated

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Feature Validation Workflow Fails

**Symptoms**:
- ‚ùå Lint errors
- ‚ùå Test failures  
- ‚ùå Commit message validation fails

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Fix formatting issues
npm run format

# Run tests locally
npm run test:coverage

# Check commit message format
git log --oneline -1
# Should follow: type(scope): description
```

#### 2. Coverage Below Threshold

**Symptoms**:
- ‚ùå "Jest: global coverage threshold not met"

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check current coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Add missing tests
# Coverage requirement: 80%
# Focus on uncovered lines shown in report
```

#### 3. Merge Conflicts in Dev

**Symptoms**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Merge conflicts when multiple features integrate

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Update feature branch with latest dev
git checkout feature/your-feature
git pull origin dev

# Resolve conflicts manually
# Edit conflicted files, then:
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: merge conflicts with dev branch"
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

#### 4. Release Branch Issues

**Symptoms**:
- ‚ùå Release preparation fails
- ‚ùå No releasable commits found

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check commit history
git log --grep="feat:" --grep="fix:" --oneline

# Ensure conventional commits exist since last release
# At least one feat: or fix: commit required
```

#### 5. Hotfix Workflow Not Triggering

**Symptoms**:
- Hotfix workflow doesn't start on branch push

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Verify branch name pattern
git branch | grep hotfix/
# Must match: hotfix/*

# Check workflow file exists
ls .github/workflows/hotfix.yml

# Verify push to correct repository
git remote -v
```

#### 6. Semantic Release No Version Created

**Symptoms**:
- ‚ùå "No release needed"
- No version bump occurs

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check commit messages since last release
git log --pretty=format:"%s" $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD

# Ensure conventional commits exist:
# feat: -> minor version
# fix: -> patch version  
# feat!: or BREAKING CHANGE -> major version
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### Failed PR Recovery

1. **Identify the issue** from workflow logs
2. **Fix locally** on the feature branch
3. **Commit with proper message**
4. **Push to trigger new workflow run**
5. **Monitor until all checks pass**

#### Failed Release Recovery

1. **Check release branch state**
2. **Fix issues directly on release branch**
3. **Test locally before pushing**
4. **Update QA issue with status**
5. **Proceed with main merge when ready**

#### Emergency Rollback

```bash
# If something breaks after merge to main
git checkout main
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push origin main

# This triggers semantic release with new patch version
# Alternatively, use specific commit hash
git revert abc123 --no-edit
```
